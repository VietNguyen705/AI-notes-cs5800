# Part 2 - Integration Test Approach

## Module Integration and Testing Strategy

For our AI-Enhanced Notes Application, I will handle 50% of the workload focusing on Note Management and Search functionality, while my two partners will each handle 25% covering Task Management and Notification/Reminder modules respectively. The key integration points occur when a user creates a note: my Note module saves it to the database and triggers the AI analysis to add tags, then Partner 1's Task Generator extracts action items from the note content to create TodoItems with inferred priorities and due dates, and finally Partner 2's Notification Scheduler can set reminders on these tasks or notes. To validate these integrations work correctly, we will test complete workflows based on our Activity Diagrams - for example, creating a note with text like "Important: call client tomorrow" should result in a note with appropriate tags, a generated task with URGENT priority and tomorrow's due date, and if a reminder is set, the user should receive a notification at the scheduled time. The final validation confirming successful integration across all three modules would be the user receiving the actual notification (via Push, Email, or SMS), similar to receiving an order completion confirmation in an e-commerce system - this proves that data flowed correctly from note creation through task generation to notification delivery.
